      "abstract": "This paper presents a two-stage, vision-based pipeline for the real-time detection of driver drowsiness using Facial Action Units (FAUs). FAUs capture movements in groups of muscles in the face like widening of the eyes or dropping of the jaw. The first stage of the pipeline employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained to detect FAUs. The output of this network's penultimate layer serves as an image embedding that captures features relevant to FAU detection. These embeddings are then used to predict drowsiness using an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier. A separate XGBoost model is trained for each user of the system so that behavior specific to each user can be modeled into the drowsiness classifier. We show that user-specific classifiers require very little data and short training time to yield high prediction accuracies in real-time.",

      "authors": "Nandagopal N V, Maanvi Nunna, Jerrin Thomas P, A G Ramakrishnan, Kanishka Sharma",
      "abstract": "This work proposes improvements in the electroencephalogram (EEG) recording protocols for motor imagery through the introduction of actual motor movement and/or somatosensory cues. The results obtained demonstrate the advantage of requiring the subjects to perform motor actions following the trials of imagery. By introducing motor actions in the protocol, the subjects are able to perform actual motor planning, rather than just visualizing the motor movement, thus greatly improving the ease with which the motor movements can be imagined. This study also probes the added advantage of administering somatosensory cues in the subject, as opposed to the conventional auditory/visual cues. These changes in the protocol show promise in terms of the aptness of the spatial filters obtained on the data, on application of the well known common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithms. The regions highlighted by the spatial filters are more localized and consistent across the subjects when the protocol is augmented with somatosensory stimuli. Hence, we suggest that this may prove to be a better EEG acquisition protocol for detecting brain activation in response to intended motor commands in (clinically) paralyzed/locked-in patients.",

      "abstract": "For computer-based assignments, students are typically expected to create programs or code-like artefacts. Such code is often evaluated on multiple parameters including functional correctness, running time, compliance with good coding practices, etc. In this paper, we present a flexible tool that not only evaluates the code's dynamic properties (functional correctness, running time, etc) but also its static properties (such as use of good programming style). Unlike existing tools, the specifics of the execution criteria (like language, result type, etc) are fed to the tool. This makes it a lot more configurable, allowing instructors to specify commands to run code in any language and define customized algorithms for output verification. We demonstrate the flexibility of our tool in two different contexts: for evaluating lab work in a course on Data Structures in C, and for evaluating assignments in SQL.",
